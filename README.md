# go-crud-k8s-demo
A very basic demo for a CRUD API built in golang and interfacing with a Postgresql DB

Originally, the intended purpose of this small demo app was to showcase a simple way to provision k8s resources on-demand for feature branches,
however the demo may be interesting beyond that use-case, so I've decided to make it available here.

Please note that the example is still WIP and the application currently only exposes two very simple GET endpoints and does not cache anything.
